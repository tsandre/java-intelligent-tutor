  * Download eclipse for whatever platform you are working on. Although the initial stages of development are platform independent, later we might to concentrate on windows ONLY for external dependencies.
  * Download subclipse plugin from [their download site](http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA). Use the _Eclipse update site URL_ for simplicity.
  * From the repository perspective in Eclipse, checkout the code from https://java-intelligent-tutor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  * Install CTAT for Windows (Java version) from its website.
  * Set up Netbeans with CTAT (see link in other links section here) to play around with CTAT without any programming requirement. This will soon become obsolete once we figure out a way to compile code using CTAT libraries in Eclipse. Currently, this step requires installing a few other softwares and changing some env settings.
